pinboard-angelesen
==================
A simple aggregator for my weekly posts. Consumes a feed from pinboard.in and exports them as markdown.

## Getting started
- Install dependencies by runing `composer install`.
  You might need to install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) first, (try `brew install composer`).
- Copy the configuration file `cp config.php.sample config.php`
- Change the Feed URL (yes you can also use php to generate tags)
 Â The URL should boil down to something like `http://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/u:UserName/t:ChosenTag/`
- run `./generate`
- check the file `preview.md`

### Adding an Intro Text
- Add the file intro.md and upon running generate the intro text will be added.


## Container things
If you don't want to install php or composer, you can use the container approach

### Use Docker for Composer
If you want to use docker for composer, you can use the following docker command:

```
docker-compose run cli bash -c "composer install"
```

### Run Script via Docker

```
docker-compose run cli bash -c /app/generate
```
